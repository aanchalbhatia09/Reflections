When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

    Using a remote repository is beneficial when you are not working along on your 
    project. Keeping the work remote rather than local will allow for easy access
    to those who are working on the same project with you or for those who want to
    use your work in anyway. Others can also add and make changes to your repository
    easily. 

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

    Pulling changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay 
    up-to-date with my remote repository will allow me the flexibility to 
    either accept or not accept the changes made by others on my repository.
    It will also help me differentiate between the work done solely by me 
    from that done by others and keep them separate.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you
use one instead of another?

    Forks are used to copy a repository by someone onto your own GitHub account.
    Clones are used to make a repository present on GitHub local so that you
    can make changes to it locally. Branches are used to make different versions
    of the project.
    Clones are used when you can make changes to the repository and you want to 
    make them locally and after that you can push those changes. When you don't 
    have permissions to push the changes on the original repository, the 
    repository is first forked to your account so that you can push any changes
    that will be visible on your account only.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote
stored locally?
