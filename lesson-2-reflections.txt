How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository?
What value do you think it offers?

	Staging area is different from the working directory and the repository in 
	the sense that staging area allows you to temporarily store files in 
	which you want to make changes and want to add to your repository as the 
	first commit. Thus, staging area works as an intermediate between the 
	working directory and the repository. 

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical
change?

	Staging area can be used to make sure that you have one commit per logical 
	change by comparing working directory and the staging area using git diff
	before commiting the changes.
